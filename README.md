# ERC-404 Contract

## Introduction

Welcome to the ERC-404 Contract repository! This repository hosts the smart contract implementation of ERC-404, an experimental Ethereum token standard that bridges the gap between ERC-20 tokens and NFTs. With ERC-404's unique mint and burn mechanism, users can transfer fractions of their NFTs or sell them on the open market via liquidity pools.

## Token Description

- **Token Name**: Maydayy semi-fung Tokens
- **Token Symbol**: MYD
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: 10,000

## Deployed Contract

The ERC404 contract has been deployed at the following address: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x42a5fc2e81ea1d94c24da0ee7d9a4c3ffaecfade](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x42a5fc2e81ea1d94c24da0ee7d9a4c3ffaecfade)

## Usage

To use the ERC-404 standard in your project, you can deploy or integrate ERC-404 compliant contracts into your smart contracts or DApps. Ensure that your contracts conform to the ERC-404 interface to ensure interoperability with other ERC-404 compliant contracts and DApps.
